\* Due to behavioral changes introduced under Java 8, some bugs are no longer
reproducible. These bugs have been removed from the commit-db, but their
metadata is still available in the project directory. As publications using
Defects4J artifacts refer to bugs by their specific bug id, we do not re-number
active bug ids of existing bugs.

The bugs
---------------
Each bug has the following properties:

- Issue filed in the corresponding issue tracker, and issue tracker identifier
  mentioned in the fixing commit message.
- Fixed in a single commit.
- Minimized: the Defects4J maintainers manually pruned out
  irrelevant changes in the commit (e.g., refactorings or feature additions).
- Fixed by modifying the source code (as opposed to configuration files,
  documentation, or test files).
- A triggering test exists that failed before the fix and passes after the fix
  -- the test failure is not random or dependent on test execution order.

The (b)uggy and (f)ixed program revisions are labelled with `<id>b` and
`<id>f`, respectively (`<id>` is an integer).


Setting up Defects4J
================

Requirements
----------------
 - Java 1.8 (version 1.5.0 and older requires Java 1.7)
 - Git >= 1.9
 - SVN >= 1.8
 - Perl >= 5.0.12

#### Java version
All bugs have been reproduced and triggering tests verified, using the latest
version of Java 1.8.
Note that using Java 1.9+ might result in unexpected failing tests on a fixed
program version. 

#### Perl dependencies
All required Perl modules are listed in `cpanfile`. On many Unix platforms,
these required Perl modules are installed by default. If this is not the case,
you can use cpan (or a cpan wrapper) to install them. For example, if you have
cpanm installed, you can automatically install all modules by running:
`cpanm --installdeps .`

#### Timezone
Defects4J generates and executes tests in the timezone `America/Los_Angeles`.
If you are using the bugs outside of the Defects4J framework, set the `TZ`
environment variable to `America/Los_Angeles` and export it.

Steps to set up Defects4J
----------------

1. Clone Defects4J:
    - `git clone https://github.com/rjust/defects4j`

2. Initialize Defects4J (download the project repositories and external libraries, which are not included in the git repository for size purposes and to avoid redundancies):
    - `cd defects4j`
    - `./init.sh`

3. Add Defects4J's executables to your PATH:
    - `export PATH=$PATH:"path2defects4j"/framework/bin`

4. Check installation:
    - `defects4j info -p Lang`

Using Defects4J
================

#### Example commands
1. Get information for a specific project (commons lang):
    - `defects4j info -p Lang`

2. Get information for a specific bug (commons lang, bug 1):
    - `defects4j info -p Lang -b 1`

3. Checkout a buggy source code version (commons lang, bug 1, buggy version):
    - `defects4j checkout -p Lang -v 1b -w /tmp/lang_1_buggy`

4. Change to the working directory, compile sources and tests, and run tests:
    - `cd /tmp/lang_1_buggy`
    - `defects4j compile`
    - `defects4j test`

5. The scripts in [`framework/test/`](framework/test/)
are examples of how to use Defects4J, which you might find useful
as inspiration when you are writing your own scripts that use Defects4J.

Defects4J uses a semantic versioning scheme (`major`.`minor`.`patch`):

| Change                                  | `major` | `minor` | `patch` |
|-----------------------------------------|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
