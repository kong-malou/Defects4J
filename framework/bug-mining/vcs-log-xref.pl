=head1 NAME

vcs-log-xref.pl -- Parses the development history log for a project screening it
with a regular expression, and validates that they pass a test provided by a
script that can verify they are bugs (as opposed to improvements, pull requests,
etc.)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

vcs-log-xref.pl -v vcs_type -e bug_matching_perl_regexp -l commit_log -r repository_dir -c command_to_verify -f output_file

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-t C<vcs_type>>

The version control system, i.e., git or svn.

=item B<-e C<bug_matching_perl_regexp>>

The perl regular expression that will match the issue, e.g., /LANG-(\d+)/mi.

=item B<-l C<commit_log>>

The part of the development history that you wish to cross-reference with an
issue tracker. This file may be obtained for example by running C<git log>.

=item B<-r C<repository_dir>>

The path to the git repo for this project (this argument is ignored for SVN
repositories).

=item B<-c C<command_to_verify>>

The command to run that will verify whether a given issue ID is a bug. The
bug-mining framework currently supplies two auxillary scripts
(C<verify-bug-file.sh> and C<verify-bug-sf-tracker.sh>) that help with this
task. You may also supply your own.
