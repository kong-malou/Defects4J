=head1 NAME

get-class-list.pl -- Run triggerng tests in isolation, monitor class loader, and
export class names of loaded and modified classes.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

get-class-list.pl -p project_id -w work_dir [-b bug_id]

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-p C<project_id>>

The id of the project for which loaded and modified classes are determined.

=item B<-w C<work_dir>>

Use C<work_dir> as the working directory.

=item B<-b C<bug_id>>

Only analyze this bug id or interval of bug ids (optional).
The bug_id has to have the format B<(\d+)(:(\d+))?> -- if an interval is
provided, the interval boundaries are included in the analysis.
Per default all bug ids are considered that are listed in $TAB_TRIGGER.

=back

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Runs the following workflow for the project C<project_id> -- the loaded classes
are written to F<C<PROJECTS_DIR>/"project_id"/loaded_classes> and the
modified classes are written to
F<C<PROJECTS_DIR/"project_id"/modified_classes>.

For all version pairs that have reviewed triggering test(s) in $TAB_TRIGGER:

=over 4

=item 1) Checkout fixed version.

=item 2) Compile src and test.

=item 3) Run triggering test(s), verify that they pass, monitor class loader,
         and export the list of class names.

=item 4) Determine modified source files from source patch and export the list
         of class names.

=back

For each loaded or modified (project-related) class, the corresponding output file contains one row
with the fully-qualified classname.

=head1 SEE ALSO

All valid project_ids are listed in F<Project.pm>.
Run after getting trigger tests by executing F<get-trigger.pl>.
After running this script, you can determine the revisions that have minimized
patches. Then you can use F<promote-to-directory.pl> to merge desired
revisions with the main database.
